# The-Movie-popularity
Investigate TMDb Movie Dataset

Every year hundreds of movies are released, with only some making it to mainstream
theaters. The problem we set out to solve is to find the best attributes to predict the popularity of
a given movie and find the best performing model. Our data science solution will use the details
involved in the production and release of a movie to make a prediction on how they influence
the popularity of a movie. Using the data modeling techniques of linear regression and
clustering we can compare the effectiveness of certain variable selectors for projecting
popularity.
